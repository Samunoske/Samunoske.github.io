<p>I'm prepping myself for DEF CON 32 - getting stickers ready, put the (last minute!) orders out there and look forward to sharing them with people at the Con.</p>
<p>I'm also looking forward to catching up with friends I've made over the years - my first DC was 28 in 2018, which seems so long ago at this point. Can't wait to see you all there!</p>
